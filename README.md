What if Balatro but with a shit-ton of memes and references to media/games?

Balatro: Everyone is HERE! is a variety mod made in Joker Forge where me and my friends can add basically anything!
It currently has 6 Jokers, but will have WAY more in the future (hopefully)!

# HOW TO INSTALL:
Requirements:
- [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)
- [Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector)

Turorial:
- Extract the Lovely Injector folder, copy the version.dll file in it and paste said file in "Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro"
- Go to C:\Users\[YOURNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Balatro and make a folder called "Mods" ("[YOURNAME]" means your computer username)
- Extract the Steamodded folder and open it, copy the "smods-main" folder and paste it in the "Mods" folder you created in AppData

MAKE SURE THE FOLDER YOUR PUTTING IN THE MODS FOLDER HAS THESE FILES INSIDE OF IT!!

- Boot up Balatro, if a code window pops up before the game, you did it correctly! If not, make sure you followed these steps correctly (or just look up a Youtube guide).
Close the game after checking!
- Now extract the Everyone is Here! folder and do the same process as the Steamodded folder

AGAIN: MAKE SURE THE FOLDER YOU'RE PUTTING IN THE "Mods" FOLDER HAS THESE FILES INSIDE OF IT!!

After these steps, when you boot up the game, you can go top the "MODS" tab (in-game) and see if it worked!
